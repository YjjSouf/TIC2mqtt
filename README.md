# TIC2mqtt #
A python script to read TIC data from the Linky meter and publish to mqtt. Also provides effective power in W.

This script reads a serial input and retrieves the TIC data if any. Only adapted to TEMPO contracts with EDF as a supplier.
To read the tic data, the reference documentation is from ENEDIS: Enedis-NOI-CPT_54E, 06/2018 https://www.enedis.fr/media/2035/download

Once data is recovered, the script updates a few mqqt topics. Computes Power based on energy consumption as a bonus.
Feel free to use this code as per the license file on github

Disclamer! This code is provided free of charge for you to use. However, errors, bugs or issues might araise.
Please, take your responsabilities. I cannot be held responsible for any loss that might be induced from the use of this script.

## Functionalities ##
- Init a port com to match Linky baud rate etc
- Reads important fields
- Check for malformed data
- Computes read effective power (W) based on the Wh meter.
- Adapatative time step to compute power:
-   High power loads will show up fast
-   Sudden drop in power will prevent actual power from being reported immediately but will settle after a few cycles.
